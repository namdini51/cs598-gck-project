## Very Basic Network Arithmetic:
- Please perform the following operations on this edgelist file. https://databank.illinois.edu/datafiles/c3y68/download
- Some useful metadata is available at https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-6389862
- Report the number of edges and nodes
- Plot the in_degree distribution of every node- does anything obvious emerge with respect to expected properties of real world networks and citation networks in particular?
- Using a random selection approach of your choice, extract 5 connected subgraphs of around 100,000 nodes each. Report min, median, and max in_degree and total_degree for all 5 in a table.
