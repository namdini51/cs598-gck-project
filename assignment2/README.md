## Clustering:
- Cluster the six networks (edge list format in CC) with Leiden algorithm as follows:
  - Leiden CPM 0.01
  - Leiden CPM 0.001
  - Leiden Modularity
- Report for ***each network and clustering*** results as follows:
  - Count of nodes and edges
  - Count and percentage of singleton and non-singleton clusters
  - Cluster size distribution for non-singleton clusters (min, quartiles, median, max sizes)
  - Node coverage (the coverage of nodes in non-singleton clusters relative to the total number of nodes in the networks)
- Report run times for each clustering. A single table is adequate.
- Report personal preference for Leiden CPM vs. Modularity
- Report which cluster quality measures do you recommend
